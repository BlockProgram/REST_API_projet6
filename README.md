# Project nÂ°6 - *[OpenClassrooms Web Dev' Bootcamp](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/141-web-developer)*

Backend infrastucture for a web app'. I had to build a REST API with Express & MongoDB to perform CRUD functions. 

### Installation ###

This repo only contains the backend of the project. Here is the frontend part that you can put in the empty folder "frontend" included in this repo: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/dwj-projet6

Clone this repo. From within the **backend AND frontend** folders, run `npm install`.

The frontend was built with Angular, run `ng serve` from within the frontend subfolder to launch the website on `localhost:4200`.

You can then run the server with `node server` **from within the "backend" subfolder**. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
